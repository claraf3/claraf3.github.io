                <h2>Purpose</h2>

                <p>Welcome to my page. This website is my final exam submission for the COMP 1850 Introduction to Web Development course at BCIT. Now that classes have transitioned to online, our final exam changed into the format of a final project. The website includes information that I have learned through the course separated into three <a href="#topics">topics</a>.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in learning more, you can visit our course website at <a href="http://students.bcitwebdev.com/" target="_blank">students.bcitwebdev.com</a>, or you can also visit our course website at <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/comp1850" target="_blank">BCIT</a>.</p>

                <h2>Internet vs World Wide Web</h2>

                <p>The internet is an umbrella term describing the global network. The global network consists of networks that are created through infrastructure & hardware (cables, cell towers, modems, etc) that allows communication and exchange between users. These indivdual networks are interconnected to form the internet. Each user connected to the internet is assigned an internet protocl (IP) address as their identification. The internet can be accessed through different methods, one of them being the world wide web.</p>

                <p>World wide web (WWW) is part of the internet and is one way for users to access the internet. WWW uses HTTP protocol to transmit and receive data through the internet, which is displayed and viewed through browsers such as chrome and firefox. These browsers are designed to be able to read the http protocol and convert lines of code into visual information for end-users. WWW is part of the internet because it makes use of internet infrasctuture (servers, cables etc) and it uses the internet protocol (IP) to identify servers and users. As comparison, other alternatives to WWW to access the internet is the email (SMTP) or instant messageing (IM).</p>
